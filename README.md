# Braaains
Braaains is a text-based zombie roguelike game that I worked on in the subject Object Oriented Design and Implementation. The engine was provided by the University and I created additional functionality using the engine as the base. The game runs on the Java console so you would need an ide if you want to run it

## Description of the game
The player was one of the survivors in a zombie apocalypse. The player will have to survive by killing zombies with a variety of weapons from fists, melee weapons and even firearms like shotgun and sniper rifle. The player can move across two different maps at will to find better gear or to survive the zombie menace.

## Goal 
The goal of the game is to kill every single zombie in both maps, and the player will lose if his/her hitpoints reaches 0 or all other human NPCs died. 

## Learning outcomes
From this game, I learned how to create new functionality based on a game engine and how to apply Object Oriented Design into practice when developing software.
